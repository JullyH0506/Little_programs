# Little_programs

Here you can find some little programs, developed using different Python modules. Most of them are connected to different math problems.

Among these programs:
* Derivative calculator (calculates derivatives of arbitrary order).
* A programme, which converts any real number from decimal to hexadecimal with the desired accuracy.
* A programme, which checks whether the input function is continuous at a given point.
